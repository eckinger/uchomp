The test suite file `orderService.test.ts` was created by migrating the original `orderService.test.js` test suite into TypeScript and aligning it with modern best practices. Below is a full explanation of what was changed and why.

### Why the changes were made:

1. **Migration to TypeScript**:

   * Migrating to TypeScript allows for **type safety**, **IDE support**, and improved **code reliability**.
   * It enables catching issues at compile-time

2. **Moving tests into `server/__tests__`**:

   * Co-locating test files with the application logic (in a `/server/__tests__` folder) helps maintain a consistent project structure.
   * Ensures that integration between services (like `userService` and `orderService`) is testable together without broken imports.

---

### Specific Changes and Explanations:

#### 1. **Import Style and Environment Setup**

**Before (JS):**

```js
const db = require('...');
const order_service = require('...');
```

**After (TS):**

```ts
import * as order_service from "../services/orderService";
import * as user_service from "../services/userService";
import { pool as db } from "../db/db";
import { randomUUID } from "crypto";
```

* Used ES module imports.
* Type-safe import of `db` and `randomUUID`.

#### 2. **User Setup (beforeEach instead of beforeAll)**

**Before:**

```js
beforeAll(async () => {
  await db.query(...);
  testUserId = ...
});
```

**After:**

```ts
beforeEach(async () => {
  testUserId = await createTestUser();
});
```

* The test user is now created **fresh before each test**, ensuring test isolation and avoiding cross-test contamination.

#### 3. **Cleanup logic**

**Before:**

```js
afterEach(async () => {
  await db.query("DELETE FROM order_group");
  await db.query("DELETE FROM food_order");
  await db.query('DELETE FROM "user"');
});
```

**After:**

```ts
afterEach(async () => {
  await db.query('DELETE FROM food_order');
  await db.query('DELETE FROM order_group');
  await db.query('DELETE FROM code');
  await db.query('DELETE FROM "user"');
});
```

* Preserved the logic, but made it **consistent with async/await practices** and added `code` table cleanup.

#### 4. **Strong typing and UUID generation**

**New:**

```ts
let testUserId: string;
const fakeUUID = "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000";
```

* Ensures `testUserId` and all expected string IDs are strongly typed.
* Avoids assumptions about the user ID type (which was an integer in the old test).

#### 5. **Error Handling in Long Name Test**

**Before:**

```js
expect(error.message).toMatch(/restaurant.*too long/i);
```

**After:**

```ts
if (error instanceof Error) {
  expect(error.message).toMatch(/restaurant.*too long/i);
} else {
  throw error;
}
```

* More robust error type-checking using `instanceof`.

#### 6. **Integration Test Improvements**
* Although integration tests are not needed yet, since they were implemented, we ensured they were used.

* Integration between `userService.send_code`, `verify`, `get_name_and_cell`, and `orderService.create_order` is handled with full type checking.
* Each database lookup is explicitly validated, making the flow less brittle.

#### 7. **Bug Fix in Location Test**

**Old:**

```js
const result = await order_service.create_order(..., location);
```

* `location` was undefined (bug).

**New:**

```ts
const result = await order_service.create_order(..., meetupLocation);
```

* Corrected variable reference.

#### 8. **Consistency in Naming and Structure**

* `test` blocks are grouped under `describe` blocks for clarity.
* Cleanup and setup are clear and reusable.

---------------------------------------------------------
The test suite file `userService.test.ts` was created by migrating the original `userService.test.js` test suite into TypeScript. Below is a full explanation of what was changed and why.

### Why the changes were made:

1. **Migration to TypeScript**:

   * Migrating to TypeScript allows for **type safety**, **IDE support**, and improved **code reliability**.
   * TypeScript provides early detection of bugs and helps enforce contracts for test inputs and outputs.

2. **Moving tests into `server/__tests__`**:

   * Co-locating test files with the application logic (in a `/server/__tests__` folder) improves test discoverability and contextual relevance.
   * It ensures better integration between `userService` and `orderService` for full-stack testing.

---

### Specific Changes and Explanations:

#### 1. **Import Style Modernization**

```js
const user_service = require('../services/userService');
const db = require('...');
```

was replaced with:

```ts
import * as user_service from "../services/userService";
import { pool as db } from "../db/db";
import { randomUUID } from "crypto";
```

* Switched to ES module-style imports to match TypeScript standards.
* Explicit import of `randomUUID` for UUID generation.

---

#### 2. **UUID-based Test User Setup**

```js
beforeEach(async () => {
  await db.query('INSERT INTO "user" (email) VALUES ($1)', [ ... ]);
});
```

was updated to:

```ts
beforeEach(async () => {
  testUserId = await createTestUser();
});
```

* Introduced a `createTestUser()` utility that generates users with UUIDs, matching the DB schema.
* Ensures test users are isolated and consistently structured.

---

#### 3. **Expanded Cleanup Logic**

```js
afterEach(async () => {
  await db.query('DELETE FROM "user"');
  await db.query('DELETE FROM code');
});
```

was extended to:

```ts
afterEach(async () => {
  await db.query('DELETE FROM food_order');
  await db.query('DELETE FROM order_group');
  await db.query('DELETE FROM code');
  await db.query('DELETE FROM "user"');
});
```

* Added cleanup for `food_order` and `order_group` to prevent cross-test contamination.
* Ensures each test starts with a clean slate.

---

#### 4. **User ID Type Checking in Verification Test**

```js
expect(typeof userRecord.rows[0].id).toBe("number");
```

was changed to:

```ts
expect(typeof userRecord.rows[0].id).toBe("string");
expect(userRecord.rows[0].id).toMatch(/^[0-9a-f-]{36}$/);
```

* Reflects that user IDs are now UUIDs (string type), not integers.
* Ensures correct format using regex matching.

---

#### 5. **Consistent Test User Creation Across Suites**

* Introduced a single utility method for creating users with full profile fields (`id`, `email`, `name`, `cell`).
* Ensures that all services depending on user records operate on valid and consistent data.

---

#### 6. **Integration Test Enhancements**

* Tests the full flow: `send_code` -> `verify` -> `get_name_and_cell`.
* Uses TypeScript to ensure type-safe propagation of email, code, and profile data.
* All DB queries are now strictly typed and validated.

---

#### 7. **Database Error Handling**

```js
jest.spyOn(db, "query").mockRejectedValueOnce(...);
```

was improved to:

```ts
jest.spyOn(db, "query").mockImplementationOnce(() => {
  throw new Error("Database connection error");
});
```

* Uses `mockImplementationOnce` to ensure predictable failure.
* Ensures the error is caught, and the error message is validated for diagnostics.

---

#### 8. **Test Consistency and Grouping**

* `describe` and `test` blocks were clearly grouped.
* All `beforeEach` and `afterEach` are consistently scoped.
* Reused constants (like email, name, cell) were factored into variables.
